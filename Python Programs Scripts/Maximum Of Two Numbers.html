<h3>In this video, we will try to understand, how to write a python program, to find the maximum of, given two numbers. </h3>
<h3>We defined a function, in line 1 with two parameters passed to it. </h3>
<h3>In line 3, we have written an if condition, which checks if variable a, is greater than or equal to, value in variable b. </h3>
<h3>If the condition is satisfied, it executes line 4 statement, within the if block, and returns variable a value. </h3>
<h3>If the condition is not satisfied, it executes line 6 statement, within the else block, and returns variable b value. </h3>
<h3>In line 9, we are declaring first variable, with name as a, to store its value in it. </h3>
<h3>In line 10, we are declaring second variable, with name as b, to store its value in it. </h3>
<h3>In line 11, we are calling the function, that is defined in line 1. </h3>
<h3>Student. </h3>
<h3>What is the goal, of this program? what is it, trying to teaching us? </h3>
<h3>This program is trying, to teach you 6 parts. </h3>
<h3>Line 1, is teaching you, how to write a syntax of a function with 2 parameters. </h3>
<h3>Line 3, is teaching you, how to write a syntax of an if block, and how to use greater than or equal to, arithmatic operators together. </h3>
<h3>Line 5, is teaching you, how to write a syntax of an else block. </h3>
<h3>Lines 9, and 10, are teaching you, how to declare, and store data in variables individually. </h3>
<h3>Line 11, is teaching you, how to call a defined function, by including parameters to it. </h3>
<h3>Line 11, is also teaching you, how to make a nested function calling, that is, first maximum function is called, and on its execution completion, its output becomes, parameter for the print function, to pring output to the console. </h3>
