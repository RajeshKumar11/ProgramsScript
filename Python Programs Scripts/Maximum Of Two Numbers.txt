In this video, we will try to understand, how to write a python program, to find the maximum of, given two numbers. 
We defined a function, in line 1 with two parameters passed to it. 
In line 3, we have written an if condition, which checks if variable a, is greater than or equal to, value in variable b. 
If the condition is satisfied, it executes line 4 statement, within the if block, and returns variable a value. 
If the condition is not satisfied, it executes line 6 statement, within the else block, and returns variable b value. 
In line 9, we are declaring first variable, with name as a, to store its value in it. 
In line 10, we are declaring second variable, with name as b, to store its value in it. 
In line 11, we are calling the function, that is defined in line 1. 
Student. 
What is the goal, of this program? what is it, trying to teaching us? 
This program is trying, to teach you 6 parts. 
Line 1, is teaching you, how to write a syntax of a function with 2 parameters. 
Line 3, is teaching you, how to write a syntax of an if block, and how to use greater than or equal to, arithmatic operators together. 
Line 5, is teaching you, how to write a syntax of an else block. 
Lines 9, and 10, are teaching you, how to declare, and store data in variables individually. 
Line 11, is teaching you, how to call a defined function, by including parameters to it. 
Line 11, is also teaching you, how to make a nested function calling, that is, first maximum function is called, and on its execution completion, its output becomes, parameter for the print function, to pring output to the console.
